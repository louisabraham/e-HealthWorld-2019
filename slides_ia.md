A few examples from the PhysioNet challenge
===========================================

-   clinical databases

-   library of publications

-   software

-   challenge

PhysioNet 2000: Detecting and quantifying apnea based on the ECG
================================================================

[@goldberger2000physiobank]

-   70 recordings of ECG signal digitized at 100 Hz with 12-bit
    resolution, continuously for approximately 8 hours split in training
    and test dataset

-   1 label per minute

-   2 tasks: detection per patient and detection per minute

-   results: 100% and 90% accuracy

PhysioNet 2004: Spontaneous Termination of Atrial Fibrillation
==============================================================

[@moody2004spontaneous]

-   Is it possible to predict if (or when) an episode of atrial
    fibrillation will end spontaneously?

-   80 one-minute recordings of two simultaneously recorded ECG signals

-   3 classes

    -   N: non-terminating AF
    -   S: terminates one minute after the end of the record
    -   T: terminates immediately after the end of the record

-   Training 10N+10S+10T, Test A 15N+15T, Test B 10S+10T

-   results: 97% and 100% accuracy

-   similar method: simple signal processing

PhysioNet 2016: Classification of Normal/Abnormal Heart Sound Recordings
========================================================================

[@liu2016open]

-   4,430 recordings taken from 1,072 subjects, totalling 233,512 heart
    sounds

-   Additional data: subject demographics (age and gender), recording
    information, synchronously recorded signals (such as ECG), sampling
    frequency and sensor type used

-   3 labels: Normal, AF, Noisy

-   2 metrics: **Se**nsitivity (detecting abnormal) and **Sp**ecificity
    (detecting normal)

========================================================================

![Quite a variety of approaches](img/physionet2016.png){height="300px"}

PhysioNet 2018: You Snooze, You Win
===================================

[@ghassemi2018you]

-   1,983 polysomnographic recordings

-   Clinical features and 13 signals

-   detect arousals

Conclusion
==========

-   Older systems are still not widely used

-   Increase in dataset sizes

-   AI is meant to complement, not replace doctors
